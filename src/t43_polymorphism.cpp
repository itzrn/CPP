/*
Polymorphism
poly -> many
morphism -> form

the thing which play the role of more than one form is polymorphism

there are twp type of polymorphism in c++
1. compile time
        means object get bound with function call in compile time(compile time ma decision leliya jata hai konsa function 
        call hone vala hai, to isliya isko static binding ya phir early binding bhi kehte hai)

        this is obtain by two method in c++
            using function overloading
            using operator overloading
2. run time
        this is achieved using virtual function, here compiler postpone which function will get call,
        means when the file start to execute then complier come to know which function will get execute
