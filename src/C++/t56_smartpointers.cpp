/*
there are basically 4 types of smart pointers
1. shared ptr
2. unique ptr
3. auto ptr -> this is depricated now, no more in use
4. weak ptr -> it is a special case of shared ptr

so two most imp ptr are : shared and unique

unique -> one resourse will exclusively owned by only one person
 means let there is a object A and it transfering its resourse to another object B then it will get
 transfered to B but vansihed from A, so one resourse is getting owned by one person

shared ptr -> when one resouse is shared between multiple objects
